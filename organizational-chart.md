## Committee Size Guidelines

### Minimum Functional Committee (8-10 people)
Core positions covered with some individuals handling multiple related roles. Works for smaller festivals but requires careful workload management.

### Optimal Committee Size (12-15 people)
All positions have dedicated coordinators with some assistant support. Provides adequate coverage while maintaining manageable coordination.

### Large Committee (16-20 people)
Multiple assistants for major roles and specialized support positions. Excellent coverage but requires intensive coordination management.

3. **Primary Coordinator Assignment** - One person per critical area

5. **Backup Designation** - Contingency coverage for critical positions
6. **Commitment Confirmation** - Clear understanding of time and responsibilities

## Integration Points

The chart shows hierarchical relationships, but successful festival planning requires constant coordination between all roles:

- **Financial Integration**: Main Coordinator ↔ Finance Coordinator ↔ All spending roles
- **Marketing Integration**: Marketing Coordinator receives updates from all participant-facing roles
- **Technical Integration**: Website Manager supports all roles using forms and digital tools
- **Volunteer Integration**: Volunteer Coordinator works with all roles needing day-of support
