## How to Use This Manual

**Before Role Assignment**: Read all sections to understand how the committee works together and what each role requires.

**During Planning**: Use your specific role section as your primary guide, but review integration points to coordinate effectively with other team members.

**For Problem Solving**: Check related sections when issues arise that cross role boundaries.

**For Continuous Improvement**: Document what works and what doesn't, then update the manual for next year's committee.
